Whip the remaining cream until stiff.

Cut cake into 3 slices, mine fell apart so I layered lots of broken pieces together.   
spread choclate sauce over the layers, saving some for pouring over the top of cake.  
On the same 2 layers also spread some cherry sauce and cherries, then added whipped cream.
